1. != is the not operator. It flips the boolean from true to false, or it can mean a value must not equal a variable 
2. ! basically flips the value from true to flase or false to true\
3. putting ! after a method usually but not always means that it will mutate the caller 
4. It will do nothing either that or it represents a ternary operator 
5. putting ? after something usually means that it will evaluate the method to a boolean truth or false 
6. putting !! before somehting usually flips it twice so flase will remain false and true will remain true
