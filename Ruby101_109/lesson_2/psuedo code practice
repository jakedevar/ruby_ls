psuedo code practice
# a method that returns the sum of two integers 
-define a method
  -give the method two argurments as parameters
  -define a return variable 
  -puts set return variable equall to arg one plus arg 2

Formal Psuedo Code

START
DEF Sum give two argurments

SET result = arg + arg

PRINT Sum 
END

# a method that takes an array of strings 
# and returns a string that is all those 
# strings concatenated together

-define a method with one arg  
  -arg.each and define a variable
  -get program to notice each indexed item
  -make a string visible that adds each item from array to string
  -maybe a += to a string 

START
DEF concat_array(X)
SET x.each 
SET S += var 
PRINT S
END

# a method that takes an array of intergers,
# and returns a new array with every otehr element

-define a method
  -make it take an array 
  -make it reutrn a new array
  -make the new array with every other interger in the old arr

START 
DEF new_arr SET arg
SET arg.map do |d|
next if d.index.odd?
PRINT newarr
END
