# exercise_5.rb

string = "welcome to america"

a = string[6]
b = string[11]
c = string[19]

# I actually dont know what this one will turn out to be
# I am going to guess though that is calls the letter
# or char just like and index would work for a array

puts a
puts b
puts c

# actually i was right :) nice !!
